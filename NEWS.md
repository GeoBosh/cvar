# cvar 0.4-0 (CRAN)

# cvar 0.3-1

* fix tests to pass with the changed R random generator.

* some new examples and minor documentation changes.


# cvar 0.3-0 (CRAN)

# cvar 0.2-1

* now `\VignetteIndexEntry` in `Guide_cvar.Rnw` is plain text.

* added experimental support for GARCH models - currently GARCH(1,1) (the API
  may change).

* now the first argument of `VaR()` and `ES()` can be a numeric vector. This is
  useful, e.g., for computing VaR by simulation.

* bugfix:  in `VaR_cdf()` and `VaR_qf()`,  the code for the `if/else` clauses
  had been wrongly swappped. 


# cvar 0.2-0 (CRAN)

* prepare for CRAN

# cvar 0.1-3

* suggest 'covr'.

* setup for travisCI and Coveralls.

* more tests.

# cvar 0.1-2

* corrected \VignetteIndexEntry in the vignette --- I used the vignette for Rdpack as a
  template but didn't change this entry, which resulted in the vignette appearing with a
  puzzling title on CRAN and other sites.!

* added author@R in DESCRIPTION.

* added experimental web site (docs/)

# cvar 0.1-1 (CRAN)

* added a doi to DESCRIPTION.


# cvar 0.1-0

* first public release.
