Description: Compute expected shortfall (ES) and Value at Risk (VaR)
    from a quantile function, distribution function, random number
    generator or probability density function.  ES is also known as
    Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Virtually any continuous
    distribution can be specified.  The functions are vectorized over
    the arguments.
